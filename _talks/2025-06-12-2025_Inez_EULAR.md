GWAS-identified RA susceptibility genes are non-uniformly expressed across RA subsets (pathotypes), with the majority of the RA susceptibility genes being upregulated in the lymphoid-rich pathotype. On the other hand, osteoarthritis susceptibility genes are primarily upregulated in fibroid- and myeloid-rich synovial tissue.
