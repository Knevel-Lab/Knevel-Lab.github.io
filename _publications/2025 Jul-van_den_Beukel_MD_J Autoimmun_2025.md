title: "Post-translationally modified proteins bind and activate complement with implications for cellular uptake and autoantibody formation"

excerpt: "Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies including those targeting self-proteins modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The complement system is known for its role in innate immune defense, but also in clearing debris and induction of antibody responses. We therefore hypothesized that complement could directly bind to PTMs and target PTM-modified proteins for clearance, or stimulate (chronic) inflammation and development of anti-PTM autoimmunity."

Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies including those targeting self-proteins modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The complement system is known for its role in innate immune defense, but also in clearing debris and induction of antibody responses. We therefore hypothesized that complement could directly bind to PTMs and target PTM-modified proteins for clearance, or stimulate (chronic) inflammation and development of anti-PTM autoimmunity.
