title: "Handwork vs machine: a comparison of rheumatoid arthritis patient populations as identified from EHR free-text by diagnosis extraction through machine-learning or traditional criteria-based chart review"

excerpt: "Electronic health records (EHRs) offer a wealth of observational data. Machine-learning (ML) methods are efficient at data extraction, capable of processing the information-rich free-text physician notes in EHRs. The clinical diagnosis contained therein represents physician expert opinion and is more consistently recorded than classification criteria components.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the overlap and differences between rheumatoid arthritis patients as identified either from EHR free-text through the extraction of the rheumatologist diagnosis using machine-learning (ML) or through manual chart-review applying the 1987 and 2010 RA classification criteria."
