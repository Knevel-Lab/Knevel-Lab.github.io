excerpt: "Because anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, life-threatening, auto-immune disease, conducting research is difficult but essential. A long-lasting challenge is to identify rare AAV patients within the electronic-health-record (EHR)-system to facilitate real-world research. Artificial intelligence (AI)-search tools using natural language processing (NLP) for text-mining are increasingly postulated as a solution."

Because anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, life-threatening, auto-immune disease, conducting research is difficult but essential. A long-lasting challenge is to identify rare AAV patients within the electronic-health-record (EHR)-system to facilitate real-world research. Artificial intelligence (AI)-search tools using natural language processing (NLP) for text-mining are increasingly postulated as a solution.
