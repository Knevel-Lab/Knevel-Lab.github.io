Digital symptom-checkers (SCs) have potential to improve rheumatology triage and reduce diagnostic delays. In addition to being accurate, SCs should be user friendly and meet patient's needs. Here, we examined usability and acceptance of Rheumatic?-a new and freely available online SC (currently with >44 000 users)-in a real-world setting.
