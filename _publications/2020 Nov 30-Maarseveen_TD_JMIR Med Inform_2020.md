excerpt: "Financial codes are often used to extract diagnoses from electronic health records. This approach is prone to false positives. Alternatively, queries are constructed, but these are highly center and language specific. A tantalizing alternative is the automatic identification of patients by employing machine learning on format-free text entries.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an easily implementable workflow that builds a machine learning algorithm capable of accurately identifying patients with rheumatoid arthritis from format-free text fields in electronic health records."
