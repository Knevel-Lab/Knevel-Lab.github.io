<h2>Digital Rheumatology Research Award 2025</h2>
In March of 2025 Tjardo Maarseveen received the prestigious Digital Rheumatology Research Award during the Digital Rheumatology Days in Berlin.<br><br>

In his research, Maarseveen demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the triage of patients with muscle and joint complaints. The AI technology he developed can predict with high accuracy whether a patient is at risk of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia—even before their visit to the rheumatologist.
The practical applications of this innovation are very promising: patients can receive the right care more quickly, and the workload in healthcare is reduced.<br><br>

<h2>EULAR Clinical Research Abstract Award 2024</h2>
In June 2024 Nils Steinz received the EULAR Clinical Research Abstract award at the EULAR Congress in Vienna. <br><br>

The EULAR Clinical Research Abstract award is a prize that is awarded annually to researchers who have presented new, 
good and interesting studies at the EULAR (The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) congress.<br> 
Steinz's research concerns the different trajectories of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
in the first year and a half after their first visit to the clinic. Patients differ in the type of inflammation they have and how well they respond to treatment. 
Classifying patients in this way could be a first step toward better segmentation of RA patients and discovering better treatment strategies to help in a more targeted manner.
